# Integrating FLITE and Lance into an Angular/Timymce app

## Setup

After cloning this repo and running `yarn` or `npm install` in the root folder, locate the `flite` and `lance` folders from the distribution archive and copy them to the `public` folder under the project root.

If you use only one of the plugins, then please edit `app.component.ts` and remove the references to the plugin you do not use.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
